# Reference Implementations

These are implementations based on the Scheme source code actually found in
chapter 10.  Their purpose is to verify the expected behaviour of the
interpreter.

A real Scheme implementation is required to actually execute these.  At least
[Guile](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/) has been tested.

## Usage

`guild original.ss`

If you see no `#f` at the beginning of each line, the tests pass.

## TODO

- [ ] improve test output
- [ ] run tests on travis-ci
