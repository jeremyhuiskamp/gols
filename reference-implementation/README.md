# Reference Implementations

These are implementations based on the Scheme source code actually found in
chapter 10.  Their purpose is to verify the expected behaviour of the
interpreter.

A real Scheme implementation is required to actually execute these.  At least
[Guile](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/) has been tested.
